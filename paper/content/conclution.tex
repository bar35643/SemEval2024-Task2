\section{Conclution}

In conclusion, this paper presents a thorough investigation into text entailment classification, 
focusing on Clinical Trial Reports (CTR) annotation. Through careful dataset curation and 
experimentation using the SemEval task 2 dataset, the study explores various approaches, 
including BERT-based models and adapter tuning. Despite challenges in environmental setup, 
the findings highlight the importance of learning rate optimization, dataset expansion 
strategies, and sentence embedding architectures in influencing model performance. 
The paper contributes valuable insights to natural language processing research, 
particularly in clinical text analysis, and sets the stage for further exploration 
in related domains.
