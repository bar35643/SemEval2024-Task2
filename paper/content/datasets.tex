\section{Datasets}\label{sec:dataset}

A group of four domain experts, including clinical trial organizers from the Manchester Cancer Institute and the 
Digital Experimental Cancer Medicine Team (DECMT), participated in an annotation task to generate entailment and contradiction 
statements for Clinical Trial Reports (CTR). Annotators were tasked with generating non-trivial statements about the contents of primary and 
secondary trials, encouraging understanding and reasoning. Each CTR was divided into four sections representing facts, and 
evidence supporting the labeled statement was selected from these facts. In cases of negation, the full CTR section was 
provided as evidence. A negative rewriting strategy was employed to create contradictory statements, and evidence contradicting 
these statements was collected \cite{jullien_semeval-2023_nodate} \cite{noauthor_nli4ct_nodate}.
Each Datapoint in the Training and Development Set have a statement, label being either Entangled or Contradiction, and one or two Prompts being
one of four different CTR sections of Adverse Events, Eligibility, Intervention or Results (see Table~\ref{tab:ds-example}). 
60\% of the Dataset are Single-Type, which then has only the Primary Prompt as relevant information and the other 40\% are 
Comparison-Type has Primary and Secondary Prompt \cite{noauthor_nli4ct_nodate}\cite{jullien_nli4ct_2023}\cite{jullien_semeval-2023_nodate}.
The SemEval task 2 dataset consists of 1700 training and 200 development samples (see Table~\ref{tab:ds-distribution}),
distributed equally between the two labels and almost for the 4 kinds of CTR sections. We use the development samples
as validation dataset to evaluate the performance of the Models.

For our further proceeding we concatenate the parts of a dataset sample as followed in Equation~\ref{eq:ds-sentence}.
The Single-Type, where there is no Second Trial (see Table~\ref{tab:ds-example}), $s_1, s_2, ... $
is empty, so the two last $[SEP]$ tokens are directly after another and for Comparison Type are all elements given, 
therefore the Sentence is exactly:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ds-sentence}
\resizebox{0.91\hsize}{!}{%
 $Sentence = [CLS] \; \textcolor{red}{stm}\;
             [SEP] \; \textcolor{green}{sec}\;
             [SEP] \; \textcolor{blue}{p_1, p_2, ... }\;
             [SEP] \; \textcolor{blue}{s_1, s_2, ... }\;
             [SEP]$      
}
\end{equation}

As our base Model for our Experiments is BERT and the respective Tokenizer uses $512$ token, to encode the Sentence, 
we have analyzed the length Distribution in a Histogram (see Figure~\ref{cap:hist}). 
Round about 70\% of all Training and Validation Datapoints are in the range of the $512$ token length. 
Visible is also the slight shift on the $x$-Axis in the tokenized form, since not every word can have a single token
representing it.
